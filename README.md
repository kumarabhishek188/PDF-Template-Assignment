# 🧾 Dynamic Multi-Page PDF-like Forms

This project is a front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based solution designed to replicate two official multi-page PDF forms:  
1. **Medical & Travel Expense Request**  
2. **Worker Progress Report**

The goal is to reproduce the layout, structure, and content of the original PDFs in a browser-friendly and print-ready format. This includes accurate headers, footers, tables, form inputs, declaration sections, and page numbers — with proper multi-page handling and printing support using CSS.

## 🚀 Tech Stack Used

- **HTML5** – for page structure and semantic content  
- **CSS3** – for styling, layout, and `@media print` support  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – for interactive features (e.g., switching between forms)  
- **Responsive Design** – compatible with desktop and print views  
- **PDF Reference** – faithfully recreated using two source PDFs as design guides

## 📄 Features

- Multi-page form layout with page-specific content  
- Switchable views for each form using navigation buttons  
- Tables for organized data input/output  
- Declaration sections with checkboxes  
- Print-optimized output with automatic page breaks  
- Clean, professional layout styled to resemble official documents
